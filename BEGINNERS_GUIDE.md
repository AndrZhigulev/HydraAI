## Understanding the Basics

### What is Code?

Code is instructions for a computer. Just like a recipe tells you how to cook:

**Recipe (for humans):**
```
1. Heat oven to 350°F
2. Mix flour and sugar
3. Bake for 20 minutes
```

**Code (for computers):**
```python
1. temperature = 350
2. ingredients = mix(flour, sugar)
3. bake(ingredients, duration=20)
```

### What is Python?

Python is a **programming language** - a way to write instructions for computers. It's:
- **Easy to read** - looks almost like English
- **Popular** - used by millions of programmers
- **Powerful** - can build anything from websites to AI

### Running Python Code

When you type:
```bash
python coordinator.py
```

This happens:
1. Python reads the `coordinator.py` file
2. Executes each line from top to bottom
3. The program runs until it finishes or you stop it (Ctrl+C)

## How Python Works

### Variables - Storing Information

Think of variables as labeled boxes:

```python
user_id = "alice123"
```

- `user_id` is the label on the box
- `"alice123"` is what's inside the box
- `=` means "store this value in this variable"

### Functions - Reusable Instructions

Functions are like mini-programs:

```python
def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
    return "done"
```

Breaking it down:
- `def` = "define a function"
- `greet_user` = name of the function
- `(name)` = input parameter (what the function needs)
- `print(...)` = what the function does
- `return` = what the function gives back

Using it:
```python
greet_user("Alice")  # Outputs: Hello, Alice!
```

### Classes - Blueprints for Objects

A class is a template for creating objects:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")

# Create a dog object
my_dog = Dog("Rex")
my_dog.bark()  # Outputs: Rex says Woof!
```

**Analogy:**
- `class Dog` = Blueprint for dogs
- `my_dog = Dog("Rex")` = Build a specific dog named Rex
- `my_dog.bark()` = Tell Rex to bark

### Imports - Using Other Code

```python
import torch
from database import HydraDatabase
```

This means:
- `import torch` = "Load the PyTorch library so I can use it"
- `from database import HydraDatabase` = "Load the HydraDatabase class from database.py"

**Why?** Don't reinvent the wheel! Use code others have written.

## Key Programming Concepts

### 1. Data Types

**String** - Text:
```python
name = "Alice"  # Text in quotes
```

**Integer** - Whole numbers:
```python
age = 25
```

**Float** - Decimal numbers:
```python
tokens = 10.5
```

**List** - Ordered collection:
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
print(fruits[0])  # Outputs: apple
```

**Dictionary** - Key-value pairs:
```python
user = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "tokens": 10.5,
    "age": 25
}
print(user["name"])  # Outputs: Alice
```

### 2. Conditionals - Making Decisions

```python
if tokens >= 0.5:
    print("You can query the model")
else:
    print("Not enough tokens")
```

This is like: "IF condition is true, do this. OTHERWISE, do that."

### 3. Loops - Repeating Actions

**For loop** - Repeat for each item:
```python
for fruit in ["apple", "banana", "orange"]:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")
```

**While loop** - Repeat while condition is true:
```python
counter = 0
while counter < 5:
    print(f"Count: {counter}")
    counter = counter + 1  # Increase counter
```

### 4. Try/Except - Error Handling

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will cause an error!
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by zero!")
```

**Why?** Programs can fail. Try/except catches errors gracefully.

---

## Deep Dive: Database

Let's understand `database.py` line by line.

### The Connection

```python
self.connection = sqlite3.connect(db_path, check_same_thread=False)
```

**What this does:**
- `sqlite3.connect(db_path)` = "Open/create a database file at this path"
- Like opening a notebook to write in
- `check_same_thread=False` = "Multiple parts of the program can use this database"

### Creating Tables

```python
cursor.execute("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        created_at TEXT,
        total_tokens REAL DEFAULT 0,
        total_work_done INTEGER DEFAULT 0
    )
""")
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `CREATE TABLE` = "Make a new table (like a spreadsheet)"
- `IF NOT EXISTS` = "Only if it doesn't already exist"
- `users` = Name of the table
- Each line in parentheses is a column:
  - `user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY` = User's ID (text), must be unique
  - `created_at TEXT` = When account was created (text/date)
  - `total_tokens REAL DEFAULT 0` = Token balance (decimal), starts at 0
  - `total_work_done INTEGER DEFAULT 0` = Tasks completed (whole number), starts at 0

**Analogy:**
```
Table: users
┌──────────┬────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ user_id  │ created_at │ total_tokens │ total_work_done │
├──────────┼────────────┼──────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ alice123 │ 2024-01-01 │ 10.5         │ 5               │
│ bob456   │ 2024-01-02 │ 8.0          │ 4               │
└──────────┴────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### Inserting Data

```python
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO users (user_id, created_at, total_tokens, total_work_done)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)
""", (user_id, datetime.now().isoformat(), 0, 0))
```

**What this does:**
- `INSERT INTO users` = "Add a row to the users table"
- `VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)` = Placeholders for actual values
- `(user_id, datetime.now().isoformat(), 0, 0)` = The actual values

**Why `?` placeholders?**
- Security! Prevents SQL injection attacks
- SQL injection = when hackers try to mess with your database

**Example:**
```python
user_id = "alice123"
# This safely becomes:
INSERT INTO users VALUES ('alice123', '2024-01-01T10:30:00', 0, 0)
```

### Querying Data

```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = ?", (user_id,))
row = cursor.fetchone()
```

**What this does:**
- `SELECT * FROM users` = "Get all columns from users table"
- `WHERE user_id = ?` = "Only rows where user_id matches"
- `cursor.fetchone()` = "Give me one result"

**Example:**
```python
user_id = "alice123"
# Query returns:
{
    'user_id': 'alice123',
    'created_at': '2024-01-01T10:30:00',
    'total_tokens': 10.5,
    'total_work_done': 5
}
```

## Deep Dive: Neural Network

Let's understand how the neural network works.

### What is a Neural Network?

Imagine teaching a child to recognize dogs:
1. Show them many pictures of dogs
2. They start noticing patterns (fur, four legs, tail)
3. Eventually, they can identify new dogs they've never seen

Neural networks work the same way:
1. Show them training data
2. They learn patterns
3. They can handle new data

### The Transformer Model

```python
class SimpleTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size=10000, embed_dim=256, ...):
        super(SimpleTransformer, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)
```

**What's happening:**

1. **`class SimpleTransformer(nn.Module)`**
   - Create a new class called SimpleTransformer
   - `(nn.Module)` means it inherits from PyTorch's Module class
   - This gives us all the neural network superpowers!

2. **`def __init__(self, ...)`**
   - `__init__` is a special function that runs when creating the object
   - Like a construction manual for building the neural network

3. **`vocab_size=10000`**
   - How many different words/tokens the model knows
   - Like a dictionary with 10,000 words

4. **`embed_dim=256`**
   - Each word becomes a list of 256 numbers
   - Example: "hello" → [0.5, -0.3, 0.8, ..., 0.1] (256 numbers)
   - These numbers capture the word's meaning

### Embeddings - Turning Words into Numbers

```python
self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_dim)
```

**What this does:**

Computers don't understand words. They understand numbers!

```
Word: "cat"
      ↓
Token ID: 42
      ↓
Embedding: [0.8, -0.2, 0.5, 0.1, ..., 0.9]  (256 numbers)
```

**Why?** Words that are similar have similar numbers:
- "cat" → [0.8, -0.2, 0.5, ...]
- "dog" → [0.7, -0.1, 0.4, ...]  (close to "cat")
- "car" → [-0.5, 0.9, -0.3, ...]  (far from "cat")

### Forward Pass - Making Predictions

```python
def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask=None):
    x = self.embedding(input_ids)
    x = x + self.positional_encoding[:, :seq_length, :]
    x = self.transformer(x, src_key_padding_mask=attention_mask)
    logits = self.output_layer(x)
    return logits
```

**Step-by-step example:**

**Input:** "The cat sat"

**Step 1: Embeddings**
```
"The" (ID: 1)  → [0.5, -0.3, 0.8, ...]
"cat" (ID: 42) → [0.8, -0.2, 0.5, ...]
"sat" (ID: 99) → [0.1, 0.7, -0.4, ...]
```

**Step 2: Add Position**
```
Position matters! "cat sat" vs "sat cat" are different

"The" + position_0 = [0.5, -0.3, 0.8, ...] + [0.01, 0.02, ...]
"cat" + position_1 = [0.8, -0.2, 0.5, ...] + [0.02, 0.04, ...]
"sat" + position_2 = [0.1, 0.7, -0.4, ...] + [0.03, 0.06, ...]
```

**Step 3: Transformer Processing**
```
The transformer "thinks" about the input:
- Relates words to each other
- "cat" and "sat" are connected (subject-verb)
- Builds understanding of the sentence
```

**Step 4: Output Predictions**
```
For each position, predict next word:
After "The" → might be "cat" (high probability)
After "cat" → might be "sat" (high probability)
After "sat" → might be "on" (high probability)
```

**Output (logits):**
```
[
  [0.1, 0.9, 0.05, ...],  # After "The", word 1 has 90% probability
  [0.8, 0.1, 0.05, ...],  # After "cat", word 0 has 80% probability
  ...
]
```

### Training - How the Model Learns

```python
loss = criterion(output, target)
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

**The Learning Process:**

1. **Make a prediction** (forward pass)
   ```
   Model predicts: "The cat ___" → "jump" (wrong!)
   Actual answer:  "The cat ___" → "sat" (correct!)
   ```

2. **Calculate error (loss)**
   ```python
   loss = criterion(output, target)
   # How wrong was the prediction?
   # High loss = very wrong
   # Low loss = close to correct
   ```

3. **Calculate gradients**
   ```python
   loss.backward()
   # For each parameter: "If I change this, does loss go up or down?"
   # Like: "If I turn left, am I getting closer or farther from home?"
   ```

4. **Update parameters**
   ```python
   optimizer.step()
   # Adjust parameters to reduce the error
   # Move in the direction that reduces loss
   ```

5. **Repeat thousands of times**
   ```
   Iteration 1: Loss = 5.2 (very bad)
   Iteration 100: Loss = 2.8 (getting better)
   Iteration 1000: Loss = 0.5 (pretty good!)
   Iteration 10000: Loss = 0.1 (excellent!)
   ```

**Real-World Analogy:**

Imagine throwing darts:
- **First throw**: Hits the wall (loss = 5.2)
- **Adjust**: "I threw too far left and too hard"
- **Second throw**: Closer to dartboard (loss = 2.8)
- **Keep adjusting**: Getting closer each time
- **After many throws**: Hitting bullseye! (loss = 0.1)

## Deep Dive: Coordinator

The coordinator is a web server. Let's understand how it works.

### Flask - Web Server Basics

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])
def register_worker():
    data = request.json
    # ... handle registration ...
    return jsonify({"message": "Success"})
```

**What's happening:**

1. **`app = Flask(__name__)`**
   - Create a web application
   - Flask handles all the web server complexity for us

2. **`@app.route('/register', methods=['POST'])`**
   - `@` is a "decorator" - adds functionality to the function below
   - `/register` is the URL path
   - `methods=['POST']` means this accepts POST requests (sending data)

3. **`def register_worker():`**
   - This function runs when someone visits `/register`

4. **`data = request.json`**
   - Get the data sent by the client
   - `request` is automatically provided by Flask

5. **`return jsonify(...)`**
   - Send a response back to the client
   - `jsonify` converts Python dictionary to JSON

**How a client connects:**

```python
# Worker sends:
requests.post("http://coordinator:5000/register",
              json={"user_id": "alice123"})

# Coordinator receives:
data = {"user_id": "alice123"}

# Coordinator responds:
return {"message": "Success"}

# Worker receives:
{"message": "Success"}
```

### Task Distribution

```python
def get_task():
    task = self.db.get_pending_task()
    self.db.assign_task(task['task_id'], user_id)
    model_params = self.model.get_trainable_parameters()
    return jsonify({
        "task_id": task['task_id'],
        "model_parameters": model_params
    })
```

**The Flow:**

1. **Worker asks**: "Give me work!"
2. **Coordinator checks database**: "What tasks are pending?"
3. **Coordinator assigns task**: "Alice will do task-123"
4. **Coordinator gets model**: "Here are the current neural network weights"
5. **Coordinator responds**: "Alice, here's your task and the model"
6. **Worker receives**: Task data + model parameters
7. **Worker trains**: Locally on their PC
8. **Worker submits**: Results back to coordinator

### Federated Averaging

```python
def aggregate_parameters(self, worker_parameters, learning_rate=0.1):
    for param_name, worker_values in worker_parameters.items():
        global_values = torch.tensor(current_params[param_name])
        worker_tensor = torch.tensor(worker_values)
        new_values = (1 - learning_rate) * global_values + learning_rate * worker_tensor
```

**What's Federated Averaging?**

Instead of all data in one place, learning happens on many devices!

**Example:**

```
Global model weights: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
Alice trained and got: [1.2, 2.1, 2.9]

Aggregate (learning_rate = 0.1):
new = 0.9 * global + 0.1 * alice
new = 0.9 * [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] + 0.1 * [1.2, 2.1, 2.9]
new = [0.9, 1.8, 2.7] + [0.12, 0.21, 0.29]
new = [1.02, 2.01, 2.99]

Global model updated to: [1.02, 2.01, 2.99]
```

**Why this works:**
- Alice's learning is blended into the global model
- 10% from Alice, 90% keep old (stable, gradual learning)
- Many workers contribute, model improves!

---

## Deep Dive: Worker

The worker client connects to the coordinator and does work.

### HTTP Requests

```python
response = requests.post(
    f"{self.coordinator_url}/get_task",
    json={"user_id": self.user_id},
    timeout=30
)
```

**What this does:**

1. **`requests.post(...)`**
   - Send an HTTP POST request
   - POST = send data to server

2. **`f"{self.coordinator_url}/get_task"`**
   - `f"..."` is an f-string - inserts variables
   - Example: if coordinator_url = "http://localhost:5000"
   - Result: "http://localhost:5000/get_task"

3. **`json={"user_id": self.user_id}`**
   - Send this data to the server
   - Automatically converted to JSON format

4. **`timeout=30`**
   - Wait maximum 30 seconds for response
   - If server doesn't respond, give up (don't wait forever!)

**The full communication:**

```
Worker                          Coordinator
  |                                  |
  |---POST /get_task--------------->|
  |   {"user_id": "alice123"}       |
  |                                  |
  |                           (process request)
  |                                  |
  |<--Response----------------------|
  |   {"task_id": "task-123",       |
  |    "model_parameters": {...}}   |
  |                                  |
```

### Training Loop

```python
while True:
    task_data = self.get_task()
    updated_parameters = self.train_on_task(task_data)
    self.submit_result(task_data['task_id'], updated_parameters)
    time.sleep(5)
```

**What's happening:**

1. **`while True:`**
   - Loop forever (until user presses Ctrl+C)
   - This is the "work loop"

2. **`get_task()`**
   - Ask coordinator for work
   - Wait for response

3. **`train_on_task()`**
   - Train the neural network
   - This is where your PC does the heavy lifting!

4. **`submit_result()`**
   - Send results back
   - Earn tokens!

5. **`time.sleep(5)`**
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Prevents overwhelming the coordinator

**Timeline:**
```
0s:  Get task
1s:  Start training
25s: Training complete
26s: Submit results
27s: Earn tokens!
27s: Sleep for 5 seconds
32s: Get next task
...  (repeat forever)
```

## Common Patterns Explained

### Pattern 1: Context Managers (`with`)

```python
with self.model_lock:
    model_params = self.model.get_trainable_parameters()
```

**What this does:**
- `with` automatically handles setup and cleanup
- `self.model_lock` ensures only one thread accesses the model at a time
- When block finishes, lock is automatically released

**Without `with`:**
```python
self.model_lock.acquire()  # Lock
try:
    model_params = self.model.get_trainable_parameters()
finally:
    self.model_lock.release()  # Unlock (even if error)
```

**Why?** Multiple workers might try to update the model simultaneously. Locks prevent chaos!

### Pattern 2: List Comprehensions

```python
input_ids = [token_to_id[token] for token in tokens if token in token_to_id]
```

**Expanded version:**
```python
input_ids = []
for token in tokens:
    if token in token_to_id:
        input_ids.append(token_to_id[token])
```

**It's just shorter syntax for the same thing!**

### Pattern 3: Try/Except

```python
try:
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**What this does:**
- `try:` = "Try this code"
- If error happens, don't crash! Jump to `except:`
- `as e` = store the error in variable `e`

**Example:**
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # Error! Can't divide by zero
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    print(f"Oops: {e}")  # Prints: Oops: division by zero
# Program continues running!
```

### Pattern 4: F-strings

```python
print(f"User {user_id} has {tokens} tokens")
```

**What this does:**
- `f"..."` = f-string (formatted string)
- `{user_id}` = insert variable's value
- `{tokens}` = insert variable's value

**Example:**
```python
user_id = "alice123"
tokens = 10.5
print(f"User {user_id} has {tokens} tokens")
# Output: User alice123 has 10.5 tokens
```

**Old way:**
```python
print("User " + user_id + " has " + str(tokens) + " tokens")
```

F-strings are cleaner!

### Pattern 5: Threading

```python
thread = threading.Thread(target=function_name, daemon=True)
thread.start()
```

**What this does:**
- `threading.Thread` = create a new thread (parallel execution)
- `target=function_name` = what function to run
- `daemon=True` = thread dies when main program dies
- `thread.start()` = start running the thread

**Why threads?**
- Main program continues while thread runs in background
- Example: Coordinator generates tasks in background while handling requests
